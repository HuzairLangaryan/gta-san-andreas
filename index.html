    <p class="text">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a 2004 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the fifth main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2002’s Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and the seventh installment overall. The game is set within an open world environment that players can explore and interact with at their leisure. The story follows Carl “CJ” Johnson, who returns home following his mother’s murder and is drawn back into his former gang and a life of crime while clashing with corrupt authorities and powerful criminals. Carl’s journey takes him across the fictional U.S. state of San Andreas, which is based on California and Nevada and encompasses three major cities: Los Santos (inspired by Los Angeles), San Fierro (San Francisco) and Las Venturas ( Las Vegas ). The game features references to many real-life elements of the world, such as its cities, regions, and landmarks, with its plot heavily based on several real-life events in Los Angeles in the early 1990s, including the rivalry between street gangs, the crack epidemic of the 1980s and early 1990s, the LAPD Rampart scandal, and the 1992 Los Angeles riots1.

        The game has been praised for its music, story and gameplay1. It was also considered one of the greatest video games ever made1. It was released on October 26th, 2004 for PlayStation 2 in North America1. It was later released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox on June 7th, 2005 in North America1.
